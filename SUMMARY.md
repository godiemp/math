## Files Generated

1. **DIFFICULTY_GAP_ANALYSIS.md** - Detailed analysis with recommendations
2. **questions_to_upgrade.csv** - Spreadsheet with all 329 questions to upgrade
   - Columns: level, subject, question_id, current_difficulty, target_difficulty, topic

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate Priority: M2 Content
- Create 50 hard/extreme questions for M2 (12 números, 16 álgebra, 12 geometría, 10 probabilidad)

### High Priority: M1 Upgrades
1. **Geometría** (88 questions) - Most questions are easy/medium
2. **Probabilidad** (85 questions) - 57% are easy difficulty
3. **Números** (76 questions) - 36% easy, 47% medium
4. **Álgebra** (80 questions) - Better distribution but still needs work

### Strategy
- For each subject, review questions in CSV file
- Upgrade promising questions from medium → hard
- Replace easy questions with harder alternatives
- Consider adding "extreme" difficulty tier for advanced students

## Target Distribution (Recommended)

For better challenge levels, aim for:
- 30-40% hard difficulty
- 40-50% medium difficulty  
- 10-20% easy difficulty (warm-up/scaffolding)

Currently, M1 has only ~19% hard questions.
