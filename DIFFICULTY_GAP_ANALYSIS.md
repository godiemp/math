- **Total questions:** 406
- **Questions below hardest level:** 334 (82.3%)
- **Hardest level available:** hard
- **Note:** No M1 subjects currently have "extreme" difficulty questions

**M2 Level:**
- **Total questions:** 4 (placeholders only)
- **Status:** Needs complete content development
- **All M2 subjects require hard/extreme level questions**

## M2 Detailed Analysis

### Critical Gap: M2 Content Missing

**Current Status:**
- M2 - Números: 1 question (placeholder, easy difficulty)
- M2 - Álgebra: 1 question (placeholder, easy difficulty)
- M2 - Geometría: 1 question (placeholder, easy difficulty)
- M2 - Probabilidad: 1 question (placeholder, easy difficulty)

**Required Content (based on official PAES distribution):**
- M2 - Números: 12 hard/extreme questions needed
- M2 - Álgebra: 16 hard/extreme questions needed
- M2 - Geometría: 12 hard/extreme questions needed
- M2 - Probabilidad: 10 hard/extreme questions needed

**Total M2 questions needed:** 50 hard/extreme level questions

---

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: M2 Content Development
1. Create hard/extreme level questions for all M2 subjects
2. Focus on advanced topics appropriate for second-year students:
   - Números: Complex numbers, advanced operations
   - Álgebra: Functions, limits, derivatives
   - Geometría: Analytical geometry, advanced concepts
   - Probabilidad: Inferential statistics

### Priority 2: M1 Difficulty Upgrades
For each M1 subject, prioritize upgrading questions in the following order:

1. **Geometría** (87.7% below hardest) - Highest priority
2. **Probabilidad** (85.0% below hardest)
3. **Números** (83.5% below hardest)
4. **Álgebra** (73.4% below hardest)

### Priority 3: Consider "Extreme" Difficulty
- No questions currently use the "extreme" difficulty level
- Consider creating ultra-challenging questions for top students
- This would provide an additional tier above "hard"

---

## Action Items

### For Gap Filling:

1. **Review easy questions** - Identify which can be made more challenging
2. **Review medium questions** - Determine upgrade potential to hard
3. **Create new hard questions** - For topics lacking sufficient challenge
4. **Develop M2 content** - Urgent need for complete M2 question bank
5. **Balance distribution** - Aim for more hard/extreme questions per subject

### Suggested Distribution Goals:

For M1 subjects, consider targeting:
- 30% hard difficulty
- 50% medium difficulty
- 20% easy difficulty (scaffolding/warm-up)

This would require upgrading approximately 50-60 questions per M1 subject.

---

## Next Steps

1. Export detailed question lists by subject
2. Review individual questions for upgrade potential
3. Develop M2 content plan with timelines
4. Consider adding "extreme" difficulty tier
5. Regular audits to maintain difficulty balance
